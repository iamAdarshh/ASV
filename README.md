# Proposal for Enhancing ASV Systems with Automation Tools

## Introduction

The ASV team works on various tasks such as user management, finance management, and content updates. Currently, everything is done manually. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks efficiency. This document proposes several applications and tools to automate these processes, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline workflows.

## Current Challenges

Before diving into proposed solutions, itâ€™s important to outline the existing challenges:

1. **Manual User Management:** Managing active, passive, and inactive members, and rights for a member is done manually, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies.
2. **Manual Finance Management:** Tracking expenses, managing budgets, and generating financial reports are done manually, which is prone to inaccuracies and delays. The main feature of this should be to allow users to click a photo of a bill, upload the bill, have the expense form filled automatically, allow users to make corrections, send the expense form for approval to the Approval team, and have refunds reimbursed to the member.
3. **Manual Task Management:** Task assignments, tracking progress, and updating statuses are handled manually, which can lead to missed deadlines and communication issues.
4. **Manual Inventory Management:** Managing inventory levels, tracking supplies, and reordering items are all done manually, risking stockouts or overstocking.
5. **Manual Website Updates:** Updating the legacy website with the latest version of WordPress and used plugins is done manually.
6. **Manual Content Creation:** Adding new posts and events to the website is done manually, which can be inefficient and slow.
